# SEARCH-KNOWLEDGE-SIMULATION

## Description: 
When making decisions, computers rely on three main ideas: search, knowledge and simulations. Knowledge is created by machine learning techniques and can be encoded as deep neural networks. Search and simulations help to understand the short and long-term consequences of possible actions. This course leads from basic concepts to state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms.

## Topics:
Decision-making in humans and machines; search; knowledge; simulation; machine learning techniques for acquiring knowledge, including feature learning and neural networks.
Many Python 3 programs will be provided to illustrate algorithms and concepts. The running example is a series of programs to play the game of Go on a small 7x7 board.

## Broad Goals of this Course:
• The main technologies in modern heuristic search

• From basics all the way to AlphaGo, Alpha Zero, and beyond

• Gain a full understanding of the foundations

• Study the biggest successes

• See how they came about

• See working code using games such as Go, TicTacToe

• Learn how to apply techniques in own projects
