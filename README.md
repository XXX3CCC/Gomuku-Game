# SEARCH-KNOWLEDGE-SIMULATION

Description: When making decisions, computers rely on three main ideas: search, knowledge and simulations. Knowledge is created by machine learning techniques and can be encoded as deep neural networks. Search and simulations help to understand the short and long-term consequences of possible actions. This course leads from basic concepts to state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms.
